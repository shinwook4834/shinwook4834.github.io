2 Corinthians 4:7–12  
7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all‑surpassing power is from God and not from us.  
8 We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;  
9 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.  
10 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.  
11 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.  
12 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

# 📖 Who Are We?

Are humans strong or weak?  
Are we like solid rock or fragile pottery?  
We often try to appear strong, but in truth we are fragile.  
A single word of criticism can wound us and keep us awake at night.  
Prayer begins with the confession: “I am nothing,” “I cannot do this alone.”  
When a person admits this, genuine prayer begins.

# 📖 Treasure in a Clay Jar

Paul calls believers “jars of clay.”  
A clay jar is fragile, easily broken.  
Yet inside that jar is a treasure — Jesus Christ.  
The more the jar is broken, the more the treasure within is revealed.

- Jar of clay = human weakness  
- Treasure = Jesus Christ  
- Purpose: to show that power belongs to God, not to us

# 📖 The "But" in Suffering — Paul’s Reversal

In verses 8–9 Paul honestly records his hardships:  
pressures from every side, perplexity, persecution, being struck down.  
Yet the original text and translations repeat the conjunction **“but.”**  
- Hard pressed, **but** not crushed  
- Perplexed, **but** not in despair  
- Persecuted, **but** not abandoned  
- Struck down, **but** not destroyed

Why? One reason: the treasure (Jesus) within him.  
The more he is broken, the more the life of Christ shines through.

# 📖 Life and Death Together

Paul says we carry the death of Jesus in our bodies (v.10–11).  
As we bear that death, the life of Jesus is revealed in our mortal bodies.  
Christian faith means experiencing death and life together.  
- Earthly weakness and heavenly strength coexist  
- When we die to ourselves, others may live — the law of sacrificial love

# 📖 Prayer and Repentance: Where Weakness Is Exposed

Prayer is the place to lay bare our weakness before God.  
Repentance dismantles and strips the self.  
The proud cannot truly pray.  
True prayer begins with the confession: “I am nothing. Help me.”  
Through that process God’s life comes and brings healing and restoration.

# 📖 Three Anxieties and Christ’s Answer

![Paul Tillich](/assets/img/20251109-03.jpg)

Connecting Paul Tillich’s three anxieties with the gospel’s answer:  
1. Moral anxiety (sin) — Christ’s forgiveness and invitation (“Come to me, all who are weary and burdened”)  
2. Anxiety about purpose (meaning) — Christ is the way, the truth, and the life  
3. Anxiety about death — Christ’s resurrection defeats death

Jesus holds all these questions and anxieties of our lives.

# 📖 Application: Do Not Fear Being Broken

Paul’s message is clear: do not fear being broken as jars of clay.  
The more broken we are, the more Christ’s resurrection life is revealed.  
A church is built by this kind of sacrificial love — “If I die, you will live.”  

Sooyoungro Church’s fifty years were sustained by tears and costly devotion.  
May individuals and the congregation become channels of greater life through vulnerability.

# 💡 Reflection Q&A

**<span style="color:lightblue">Q1. Why does Paul call himself a ‘jar of clay’?</span>**  
A1. To acknowledge human frailty and to show that God’s power appears through our weakness.

**<span style="color:lightblue">Q2. What does the repeated “but” in the passage signify?</span>**  
A2. It marks a reversal principle: despite suffering and weakness, we do not collapse because of the treasure within the jar.

**<span style="color:lightblue">Q3. Why are prayer and repentance essential?</span>**  
A3. Prayer exposes our weakness to God; repentance dismantles the self and opens the way for God’s life to work in us.

**<span style="color:lightblue">Q4. What does “death and life together” mean in practice?</span>**  
A4. Our sacrifice and vulnerability become the means by which others and the community receive life.

**<span style="color:lightblue">Q5. What does Paul’s call to not fear breaking ask of us today?</span>**  
A5. It calls us to discard pride and pretense, treasure Christ within, and allow God’s power to be revealed in our weakness.
