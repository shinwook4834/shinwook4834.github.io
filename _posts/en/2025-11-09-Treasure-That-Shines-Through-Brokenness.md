2 Corinthians 4:7–12  
7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.  
8 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;  
9 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.  
10 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.  
11 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body.  
12 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.

# 📖 Treasure in Jars of Clay

Are we strong beings or fragile ones?  
Are we like solid rock or breakable pottery?  
Paul writes:  
> “We have this treasure in jars of clay…” (2 Cor 4:7)

The treasure within us is **Jesus Christ**,  
and we are the **jars of clay** that carry Him.

# 📖 Human Weakness and Pretended Strength

In life, we quickly realize how fragile we are.  
- A single criticism can wound us deeply  
- We come to worship not because we’re strong, but because we have prayer needs  
- Bowing in prayer is a confession: **I need grace**  

People love to disguise themselves.  
- They want to appear impressive and strong  
- But when broken, pride and hypocrisy spill out  
- That’s the true nature of humanity

# 📖 Paul’s Realization

Before meeting Jesus, Paul was a man of religious conviction.  
But in the mission field, he realized:  
> Life is as fragile as a **jar of clay**.  

He confesses:  
> “We are hard pressed… but not crushed… persecuted, but not abandoned…” (2 Cor 4:8–9)

In the original Greek, the word **“but”** appears repeatedly.  
- Though afflicted, **but** not crushed  
- Though persecuted, **but** not abandoned  

Paul’s words are a declaration of **spiritual endurance and victory**.  
Why?  
Because **Jesus, the treasure, lives within us.**

# 📖 Death and Life Flow Together

Paul writes:  
> “We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus,  
> so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.” (2 Cor 4:10)

- Weakness and strength coexist  
- Earthly fragility and heavenly power flow together

# 📖 Prayer Is Where Weakness Is Revealed

Prayer is the place where we expose our weakness.  
- Repentance in prayer breaks us and grows us  
- We strip away our pride and come before God  
- The proud cannot truly pray  
- The Pharisee’s prayer was full of self-praise  
- True prayer is laying down weakness and encountering life

# 📖 It’s Okay to Be Broken—Jesus Will Shine Through

![깨진 질그릇](/assets/img/20251109-01-960.webp)

Brokenness is not something to fear.  
Because when we break, **Jesus is revealed.**

The greatest benefit of believing in Jesus  
is that He bore our sins,  
and now we can call God **“Father”** as His children.  

When we come to worship and say, “God, I’m here,”  
He responds, “Welcome, my beloved son, my beloved daughter.”

# 📖 When the Jar Breaks, the Treasure Shines

Paul says:  
> “Do not be afraid of being broken.”  

- A jar that remains whole hides what’s inside  
- But when it breaks, **the fragrance and light of Christ** are revealed  
- We must accept that we are breakable beings
