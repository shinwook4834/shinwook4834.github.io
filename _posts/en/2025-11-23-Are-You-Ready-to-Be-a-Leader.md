John 13:1–17  
1 It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.  
2 The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus.  
3 Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;  
4 so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.  
5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.  
6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”  
7 Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”  
8 “No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”  
9 “Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!”  
10 Jesus answered, “Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”  
11 For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not everyone was clean.  
12 When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” he asked them.  
13 “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.  
14 Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.  
15 I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.  
16 Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.  
17 Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.”

# 📖 The Passover Meal and Foot Washing

At the Last Supper, the disciples looked for someone to wash their feet.  
In those days, people wore sandals on dusty roads, and servants customarily washed the guests’ feet.  
But Jesus Himself took off His outer garment, tied a towel around His waist, and began to wash His disciples’ feet.

- Washing feet was the task of the lowest servant.  
- Yet the Lord Himself performed this humble act.  

Peter resisted strongly.  
It seemed unthinkable that the Teacher would wash the feet of His disciples.  
But Jesus said:  
> “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.” (John 13:8)

# 📖 The Example of the Lord — Jesus the Servant

Jesus showed His disciples the path they must walk.  
Within this act lay the essence of salvation.  
The Lord came as a servant and lived as one.  

- In a time when the Roman emperor was worshiped as absolute power  
- People sought authority, and some wanted to make Jesus a ruler  
- Yet Jesus did not go to the public square but to the wilderness  
- The towel around His waist was the image of a perfect servant  

Philippians 2:7–8 says:  
> “He made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness…”  

Jesus’ humility was not a momentary gesture but His entire life as a servant.

# 📖 Wash One Another’s Feet

Jesus said:  
> “Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.” (John 13:14)

- Our identity is that of servants.  
- In the church, a deacon means one who serves at the table.  
- An elder means one who leads by example.  
- Both deacons and elders must serve from the position of a servant.

# 📖 The Limits of the Disciples and the World’s Order

Though the disciples followed Jesus for three years, they still argued about status and position.  
They knew in their minds but failed to act in service.  
In a fallen world, true service does not exist.  
People seek to dominate and rise above others.

# 📖 Service from the Cross

True service begins at the cross.  
Service is difficult.  
We may think, “At my age, in my position, with my experience, should I do this?”  
But Jesus silently set the example.  
> “I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.” (John 13:15)

- The humility of the cross does not fear descending.  
- Those who have experienced the cross do not worry.  
- The safest place is at the foot of the cross.

# 📖 The Lord Still Seeks Servants

- The humble are always ready to be used.  
- The world is full of places to serve.  
- A healthy community is marked by service.  
- A good church is one with many servants.  
- A church with more people wanting to be served than to serve will fall into corruption.  

Service must follow Christ’s example, not our own.  
The King of kings tied a towel around His waist.  
We do not need “supermen” but **towel-men.**  
We must always carry the towel, ready to serve.

# 📖 The Lord Who Loved to the End

John 13:1–2 says:  
> “Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.”  

- The Lord’s love does not yield to evil.  
- Nothing can stop His love.  
- If we choose whom to serve, we will serve no one.  

---

# 📖 Know and Do

Jesus said:  
> “Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.” (John 13:17)

- Knowing is not enough.  
- Saying “Amen” is easy, but serving with our bodies is hard.  
- Having received Jesus’ service, we are now able to serve others.  
- It is not enough to know; we must act.
