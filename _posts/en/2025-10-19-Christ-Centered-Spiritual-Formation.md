Galatians 3:1–6  
1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.  
2 I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?  
3 Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?  
4 Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?  
5 So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?  
6 So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

# 📖 Moral Temptation and Hidden Faith

Professor John Coe of Talbot Seminary once said:  
> “Many seminary students want to be used by God,  
> but deep inside, they carry shame and guilt.”

This isn’t just about students.  
Many believers feel **“I’m not enough”** and try to cover it with effort and morality.  
That’s the core of **moral temptation**—trying to fix spiritual emptiness with performance.

Paul asks the Galatians:  
> “After beginning by the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by the flesh?” (Gal 3:3)

# 📖 What Is Moral Temptation?

It’s not just about bad behavior.  
It’s the thought:  
**“Maybe I just need to try harder.”**  
**“Maybe I can fix this myself.”**

Instead of bringing guilt and shame to Jesus,  
we try to solve it through effort, discipline, and moral performance.

Paul reminds us:  
> “Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by believing what you heard?” (Gal 3:2)

# 📖 Hiding Faith, Covered Obedience

Adam and Eve sinned—but they didn’t say,  
> “God, help us.”  
They hid.

We do the same.  
- Prayer becomes a mask  
- Obedience becomes a cover  
- Goodness becomes a disguise

Paul warns:  
> Even prayer and obedience can be used to hide from God.

# 📖 Honesty at the Cross

Spiritual formation begins when we stop hiding.  
Prayer is not a place to look good—  
It’s a place to be real.

- “God, I don’t want to pray right now.”  
- “God, I love You—but I also love other things.”  
- “God, please forgive me.”

This is the heart of spiritual formation—  
**honesty at the foot of the cross.**

# 📖 Law vs. Gospel, Effort vs. Grace

The Judaizers said:  
> “We’re saved by faith, but we grow by effort.”

But Paul says:  
> “We are saved by faith, and we grow by faith.”

- The law is a tutor that leads us to Christ  
- Shame and guilt cannot be solved by effort  
- Only Jesus is the answer

---

# 📖 Justification: His Righteousness for Our Sin

2 Corinthians 5:21 says:  
> “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us,  
> so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”

- Our sin was transferred to Jesus  
- His righteousness was transferred to us

**This is justification—the heart of the gospel.**  
We are no longer condemned.  
**Jesus is enough.**

---

# 📖 Reflection and Challenge

Try praying like this:

- “God, I don’t want to hide anymore.”  
- “I give You my shame and guilt.”  
- “I can’t fix this. Only Jesus can.”

Then the cross will grow larger,  
and God’s love will feel deeper.
