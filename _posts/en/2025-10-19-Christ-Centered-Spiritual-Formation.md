Galatians 3:1–6  
1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.  
2 I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?  
3 Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?  
4 Have you experienced so much in vain—if it really was in vain?  
5 So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard?  
6 So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”

# 📖 Returning to the Cross

The apostle Paul speaks firmly to the Galatians:  
> “You foolish Galatians!”

They had believed in the cross of Jesus Christ,  
but over time, they began turning back to law and human effort.  
Paul asks:  
> “Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard?”

In other words:  
**You began with the cross—why are you trying to finish by the flesh?**

# 📖 Moral Temptation and Spiritual Drought

Preacher and Talbot Seminary professor John Coe once said:  
Many students appear to be doing God’s work,  
but deep inside, they are burdened by shame and guilt.

They often ask:  
> “Where is the never-failing well God promised?”

Moral temptation isn’t just about bad behavior.  
**“Maybe I just need to try harder.” “Maybe I can fix this myself.”**  
These thoughts are temptations in themselves.  
Instead of turning to God in guilt,  
we try to solve it through effort and morality.

# 📖 Flesh vs. Spirit-Filled Faith

When Paul speaks of “the flesh,”  
he doesn’t just mean lust or evil deeds.  
He means **trying to solve spiritual problems by human effort.**

- Human approach → hiding, striving, moralism, perfectionism  
- God’s approach → coming honestly to the cross, asking for help, relying on grace

Adam and Eve didn’t say,  
> “God, we need You.”  
They hid.

Are we still hiding in guilt and shame today?

# 📖 Spiritual Formation Begins Where Hiding Ends

To grow spiritually, we must first **step out from hiding.**

- Speak honestly before God  
- Don’t try to fix sin alone—confess and bring it into the light  
- Prayer isn’t about sounding good—it’s about being real

Thinking “I’ll just be more moral”  
is not spiritual growth—it may be **spiritual regression.**

True formation begins with this confession:  
> “God, I have much to hide. Please help me.”

# 📖 Jesus Christ, the Center of Spiritual Formation

2 Corinthians 5:21 says:  
> “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us,  
> so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”

Jesus took all our sin.  
He forgave us 100%.  
So there’s no need to hide,  
no need to live in guilt anymore.  
We are now **free.**

# 📖 Reflection and Challenge

Try beginning your prayer like this:

- “Lord, I don’t want to hide anymore.”  
- “I want to speak from the depths of my heart.”  
- “I give You my shame, my sin, my fear—everything.”  
- “I trust and follow the One who has forgiven me.”

Then the cross will appear greater,  
and God will feel closer.
