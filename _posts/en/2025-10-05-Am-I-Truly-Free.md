John 8:31-36  
31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.  
32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”  
33 They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”  
34 Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.  
35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.  
36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”

# 📖 An Age of Freedom, Yet Not Truly Free

We call this the age of freedom.  
Yet in reality, people live bound by countless chains.  
Are we truly free, or are we slaves to invisible shackles?  

The Bible says:  
**“Everyone who sins is a slave to sin.”** (John 8:34)  
We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners.  
Humanity is, by nature, enslaved to sin.

# 📖 God’s Greatest Gift: Freedom

In the Garden of Eden, God gave humanity freedom.  
More important than abundance was freedom itself.  
The one restriction—the tree of the knowledge of good and evil—marked the boundary between Creator and creature.  

But Satan twisted that boundary.  
“God doesn’t want you to eat it because you might become like Him.”  
Satan provoked human pride and led them to distrust God.  
In the end, freedom was lost, and humanity became slaves to Satan.

# 📖 The Power of Sin and Human Helplessness

Sin never lets us go.  
Like the prodigal son, the pursuit of freedom apart from God leads only to ruin.  
King Saul sat on the throne, yet lived like a slave to hatred.  
Even David, a man after God’s heart, became a prisoner of desire.  

Today is no different.  
Addictions, obsessions, fears…  
We claim to be free, but in truth, we live in the prison of sin.

# 📖 The Truth That Sets Us Free

Jesus declared:  
**“Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”** (John 8:32)  

- Truth is not mere knowledge.  
- It is lived, embodied, and experienced.  
- Truth is Jesus Christ Himself.  

When the adulterous woman was brought before Him, Jesus turned the accusers’ eyes back to themselves.  
We see others’ sins but fail to see our own.  
Without truth, we cannot even know who we are.

# 📖 The Spirit of Adoption, Not Fear

Romans 8:15 says:  
> “The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.”

Even religion can bind people with fear.  
But the gospel gives us the **Spirit of adoption**.  
We are no longer slaves, but children of God.

# 📖 True Freedom: The Freedom Not to Do

Freedom is not simply doing whatever we want.  
It is the **freedom not to do** what enslaves us.  

- Paul rejoiced in calling himself “a servant of God.”  
- He was a prisoner of love, yet free in truth.  
- A life led by the Word is a life of true freedom.  

On our own, we cannot overcome sin.  
But Christ fights for us and sets us free.

# 📖 Conclusion: Not Slaves of Sin, But Servants of Christ

Sin constantly tries to lock us inside ourselves.  
But when the light of truth shines, the prison doors open.  

**True freedom is found only in Christ.**  
We are not slaves of sin but servants of Christ.  
Only in Him can we become truly free.
