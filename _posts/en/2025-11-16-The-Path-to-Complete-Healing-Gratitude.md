Luke 17:11–19  
11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.  
12 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance  
13 and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”  
14 When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.  
15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.  
16 He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.  
17 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?  
18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”  
19 Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”

# 📖 Leprosy and the Reality of Despair

In Jesus’ time, leprosy was the most hopeless disease.  
It began with spots on the skin, grew into swelling, disfigured the face, and eventually led to death.  

- Lepers were isolated from family and community  
- The Law required them to stay at least 45 meters away from others  
- Healing was rare, and if healed, they had to be certified by a priest  

Into this desperate situation, Jesus encountered ten lepers.

# 📖 The Event: Ten Healed, One Grateful

The ten lepers cried out:  
> “Jesus, Master, have pity on us.” (Luke 17:13)  

Jesus commanded:  
> “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” (Luke 17:14)  

As they went, they were cleansed.  
Yet only one—a Samaritan—returned to glorify God and thank Jesus.  

Jesus asked:  
> “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?” (Luke 17:17)  

And to the one who returned He said:  
> “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.” (Luke 17:19)

# 📖 The Priority of Gratitude — Do Not Miss the Timing

- Nine rushed to the priests, but the Samaritan first returned to Jesus with thanks.  
- Gratitude is about timing: it must be given at the moment grace is received.  
- Grace fades quickly, and human memory is short.  
- Psalm 103:2: *“Forget not all his benefits.”*  

**Gratitude delayed is gratitude lost.**

# 📖 The Rarity of Gratitude — Where Are the Nine?

- Only one out of ten gave thanks.  
- Gratitude is not natural; complaint and grumbling are.  
- Israel’s history was filled with murmuring despite God’s miracles.  
- Today, consumerism and comparison rob us of gratitude.  

But gratitude breaks the power of greed.  
**Gratitude redirects the heart toward abundance.**

---

# 📖 Gratitude Must Be Expressed

- Silent gratitude is incomplete.  
- Worship is the concrete expression of thanks to God.  
- Prayer must include expressed thanksgiving.  
- Keep a gratitude journal to record even small blessings.  

**Small acts of gratitude create great waves of blessing.**

# 📖 Gratitude Completes Healing

Paul Tournier: *“Do not treat the disease; treat the patient.”*  
Physical healing alone is incomplete; gratitude brings wholeness to the soul.  

Only the one who returned received salvation.  
- Experiencing a miracle is not the blessing  
- Responding with gratitude is the true blessing  

**Gratitude strengthens faith and brings confidence in prayer.**

# 📖 Gratitude as a Mark of Spiritual Health

- The most deadly leprosy is spiritual leprosy: sin and separation from God.  
- An ungrateful soul remains sick.  
- Romans 1:21: *“For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him…”*  

![Abraham Heschel](/assets/img/20251116-02-960.webp)

Abraham Heschel:  
> “Receive everything in life with gratitude,  
> and practice never taking anything for granted.”  

**Gratitude is the evidence of spiritual health.**

# 📖 Conclusion — Am I Among the Nine or the One?

Jesus still asks about the nine.  
Because gratitude is essential for complete healing.  

- Gratitude must become a habit  
- Gratitude must be a natural way of life, not forced  
- Gratitude restores relationships and transforms communities  

**Only the grateful truly experience complete salvation.**

Like the Samaritan who returned,  
may we all live lives marked by gratitude.
