Luke 17:11–19  
11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.  
12 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance  
13 and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”  
14 When he saw them, he said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.  
15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.  
16 He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan.  
17 Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?  
18 Has no one returned to give praise to God except this foreigner?”  
19 Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”

# 📖 The Text and the Absence of Gratitude

As Jesus passed between Samaria and Galilee, ten lepers cried out from a distance:  
> “Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”  

Jesus told them, “Go, show yourselves to the priests,” and as they went, they were cleansed.  
Yet only one returned to give thanks—and he was a Samaritan.  

Jesus asked:  
> “Where are the other nine?”  

All ten received physical healing, but only one received salvation.  
**Gratitude completes healing.**

# 📖 The Timing of Gratitude Matters

Gratitude must be expressed at the right moment, or it fades.  
When prayer is answered, we must give thanks immediately.  
Delaying gratitude often robs us of it.  

- Grace grows dim with time  
- Human memory is short  
- Psalm 103:2: *“Forget not all his benefits.”*  

If we miss the moment, we may never give thanks at all.

# 📖 Complaining Is Easier Than Gratitude

Only one out of ten gave thanks.  
Am I among the 10% who are grateful, or the 90% who are not?  

Human nature leans more easily toward complaint than gratitude.  
- Consumer culture makes us feel perpetually lacking  
- Greed is never satisfied  
- Greed only breeds more greed  

But gratitude breaks the power of greed.  
Gratitude changes the direction of the heart.  
- Comparison reveals lack  
- Gratitude reveals abundance  

> “I already have so much” — gratitude teaches us this truth.

# 📖 Gratitude Must Be Expressed

Gratitude is not real until it is expressed.  
It becomes gratitude when shown in words, actions, and life.  

- Simply being present in worship is an expression of thanks  
- Gratitude requires practice  
- Writing down thanksgiving topics can easily yield a hundred items  

**Gratitude is not just a feeling—it is the fruit of faith expressed.**

# 📖 Gratitude Completes Healing

Paul Tournier once said: *“Do not treat the disease, treat the patient.”*  
Healing is not complete until gratitude is expressed.  

Only the one who returned heard Jesus say:  
> “Your faith has made you well.”  

- Experiencing a miracle is not the blessing  
- Responding to the miracle with gratitude is the blessing  

Gratitude strengthens faith and brings confidence in prayer.

# 📖 Gratitude Is the Mark of the Spiritual Person

Romans 1:21 teaches that ingratitude marks the unbeliever.  
Every moment and every gift is God’s grace.  

- Gratitude transforms life  
- Gratitude and despair cannot coexist  
- Gratitude is the light that dispels darkness  

Abraham Heschel wrote:  
> “Receive everything in life with gratitude,  
> and practice never taking anything for granted.”

# 📖 Conclusion — Which of the Ten Are We?

Jesus still asks about the nine who did not return.  
Because gratitude is necessary for complete healing.  

- Gratitude must become our second nature  
- Gratitude must become our habit  
- Every moment of life must become gratitude  

The one who returned received not only healing but salvation and transformation.  
**Gratitude gave him a gift far greater than the other nine received.**  

So let us ask ourselves:  
Am I among the one who gives thanks, or the nine who do not?  

May gratitude become the character of our lives,  
so that in every area we live as people who give thanks to God.
