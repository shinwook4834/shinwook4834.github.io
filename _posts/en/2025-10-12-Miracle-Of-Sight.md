John 9:1–12  
1 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.  
2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”  
3 “Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.  
4 As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.  
5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”  
6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.  
7 “Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.  
8 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”  
9 Some claimed that he was. Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” But he himself insisted, “I am the man.”  
10 “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.  
11 He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”  
12 “Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said.

# 📖 More Than a Healing—A Spiritual Awakening

The healing of the man born blind is not just a miracle—  
It’s a sign, a symbol, a revelation.  

Jesus had just declared:  
> “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12)  

And now, He meets a man who has never seen light.  
This was no coincidence. Jesus approached him with intention.  

The disciples ask:  
> “Who sinned?”  

But Jesus redirects the question:  
> “This happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.” (John 9:3)  

The focus shifts from the man’s blindness to **God’s purpose**.

# 📖 Who Is Truly Blind?

This story is not just about physical sight.  
It’s about **spiritual blindness**.  

- The Pharisees argue about the Sabbath.  
- They miss the miracle and fixate on the rules.  
- Though they see, they are blind to the light.  

The real question is:  
**Who is truly blind?**  
Those who cannot see, or those who refuse to see?

# 📖 In Darkness, Anyone Can Become a Monster

Adolf Eichmann orchestrated the murder of 1.2 million people.  
When captured in Argentina, he looked like an ordinary neighbor.  
> “I was just following orders,” he said.

In darkness, anything is possible.  
Without light, even we can become monsters.  
Darkness blurs the line between good and evil.  
It numbs the conscience.

# 📖 When the Eyes Open, Everything Changes

Helen Keller once said:  
> “If I could see for just one day, I would first look at the faces of those I love.”  

Though blind, her heart could see.  
She longed for beauty, truth, and light.  

When Jesus opens our eyes:  
- We begin to hear the Word.  
- We begin to see God’s work.  
- We begin to understand eternity.  

**Only those who have seen the light can describe it.**  
And the first response is always: **awe.**

# 📖 Living as Children of Light

Ephesians 5:8 says:  
> “For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.”

We are no longer blind beggars.  
We are children of light.  

- The world cannot fight darkness on its own.  
- Only light can expose evil.  
- Only truth can awaken the soul.  

Like Nicodemus, we must be born again.  
We must receive **new senses**—  
To see, hear, and feel the presence of God.

# 💡 Reflection Q&A

**<span style="color:lightblue">1. Why did Jesus heal the blind man?</span>**  
- Not just to restore sight, but to reveal the work of God and expose spiritual blindness.  

**<span style="color:lightblue">2. Who is the real blind person in this story?</span>**  
- Not the man born blind, but those who refuse to see the truth—like the Pharisees.  

**<span style="color:lightblue">3. What happens when we live in darkness?</span>**  
- We lose moral clarity, become numb to evil, and risk becoming something we never imagined.  

**<span style="color:lightblue">4. What changes when our eyes are opened by Christ?</span>**  
- We begin to see God’s truth, beauty, and purpose in the world and in our lives.  

**<span style="color:lightblue">5. What does it mean to live as children of light?</span>**  
- To reflect Christ’s light in a dark world, to walk in truth, and to help others see.
