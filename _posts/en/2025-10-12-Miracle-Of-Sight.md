John 9:1–12  
1 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.  
2 His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”  
3 “Neither this man nor his parents sinned,” said Jesus, “but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.  
4 As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.  
5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”  
6 After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes.  
7 “Go,” he told him, “wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.  
8 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”  
9 Some claimed that he was. Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” But he himself insisted, “I am the man.”  
10 “How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.  
11 He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”  
12 “Where is this man?” they asked him. “I don’t know,” he said.

# 📖 The Light of the World Meets the Blind

Jesus said:  
> “I am the light of the world.” (John 8:12)  
> “While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” (John 9:5)

And that light reached a man who had been blind from birth.  
This encounter was no accident.  
Jesus intentionally approached someone living in darkness.

John 8 and 9 are connected.  
Jesus didn’t just heal a man—  
He revealed the work of God through him.

# 📖 The Disciples Ask About the Cause of Suffering

The disciples asked:  
> “Who sinned, this man or his parents?”

People often want to find the cause of suffering.  
But Jesus answered differently:  
> “This happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.” (John 9:3)

Rather than focusing on the cause,  
**we must look for what God is doing through the suffering.**

# 📖 God’s Way of Opening Eyes

Jesus spit on the ground, made mud, and put it on the man’s eyes.  
Then He told him to wash in the Pool of Siloam.  
It may seem unsanitary, but  
**this was a method only God could use.**

Miracles don’t follow human logic.  
**They happen only by God’s power.**  
Only God can open blind eyes.

# 📖 Humanity in Darkness

This healing wasn’t just physical.  
It symbolized Jesus’ mission to lead humanity out of darkness.

Like Genesis 1:2,  
the world was formless, empty, and dark.  
Isaiah 6:9–10 says:  
> “They see but do not perceive, hear but do not understand.”

Without Christ, we were in total ignorance.  
Without light, there is no moral compass.  
Even when we hear the Word, we don’t recognize it.

# 📖 The Banality of Evil and the Need for Sight

Adolf Eichmann orchestrated the murder of 1.2 million people.  
Yet he looked like an ordinary man.  
> “I was just following orders.”

Hannah Arendt called this **“the banality of evil.”**  
A person who doesn’t think or discern  
can become a monster in the dark.

# 📖 What Happens When Eyes Are Opened

Jesus opened the blind man’s eyes.  
But the real revelation was this:  
**Who is truly blind?**  
The Pharisees—those who rejected God.

When our eyes are opened:  
- We hear the Word  
- We see God’s work  
- We recognize eternity and life

When light comes,  
**Scripture becomes clear, and our path becomes visible.**

# 📖 Living as Children of Light

> “For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord.  
> Live as children of light.” (Ephesians 5:8)

We are no longer blind.  
Jesus opened our eyes.  
Those who have seen the light cannot return to darkness.

Now we must:  
- Stand in awe  
- Live as those who see  
- Lead others out of the dark

Like Nicodemus, we need **new senses**.  
We must rise from the cave and walk toward the light.
