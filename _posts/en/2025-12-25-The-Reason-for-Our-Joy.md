9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear.  
10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  
11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.  
12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.”  
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,  
14 “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”

# 📖 The One Thing That Completes the Meaning of Life: “Joy”

There are many things people need in order to live. But if we were to choose the most essential of them all, it would undoubtedly be *joy*. No matter how much money we have, how nice a house we live in, or how great a success we achieve—if there is no joy in our hearts, all of it loses its meaning. Only when there is joy in life can we truly experience happiness.

Yet living a life filled with genuine joy is never easy. Everyone knows that joy cannot be bought with money. People constantly search for joy, but the joy the world offers often leaves behind deeper emptiness and pain after a fleeting moment of pleasure. In his book *Surprised by Joy*, C. S. Lewis speaks of the profound emptiness that follows the pursuit of worldly joy. False joy never brings true satisfaction. In the end, we come to realize that neither this world nor our own efforts can create lasting joy.

# 📖 “Good News of Great Joy” for the Whole World

In a world filled with fear and suffering, the angel proclaims the birth of baby Jesus as “good news of great joy.” This joy is fundamentally different in nature from the joy we experience in the world. It is not a temporary emotion that comes from good circumstances, but a joy that transforms our very existence.

Why, then, is the birth of Jesus—the gospel—“great joy” for all humanity? It is because within it lies the joy of the *forgiveness of sins*.

# 📖 The Root of All Misery: The Problem of Sin

When we trace all human misery back to its source, we ultimately arrive at the problem of *sin*. The psalmist confesses that when he did not acknowledge his sin, his bones wasted away and his strength was dried up as by the heat of summer (Psalm 32:3–4). Sin weighs heavily on our souls and robs us of joy. A person burdened by guilt can never have true peace or confidence.

The power of sin is so strong that we can never break its chains by our own strength. Sin enslaves us. Without resolving the problem of sin, nothing can bring us true joy. The only answer to this desperate problem is Jesus Christ, the Son of God. He alone can resolve the problem of sin and grant us freedom from its bondage.

# 📖 An Incomparable Gift: The Joy of Salvation

The joy of receiving forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ cannot be compared with any joy this world offers. This joy is not given to a select few, but—as the angel declared—to “all the people,” to all humanity. God sent His one and only Son into this world for us. Taking on human flesh, Jesus went to the cross and died in our place, bearing all our sins—past, present, and future—and leading us into eternal salvation.

Salvation is the greatest gift God has given us and the true source of joy. Though King David possessed everything, after he sinned he prayed earnestly for one thing above all else: “Restore to me the joy of your salvation” (Psalm 51:12). He knew that no earthly wealth or honor could replace the joy of salvation. Salvation transforms us into entirely new beings and grants us true life.

# 📖 Peace That Extends Beyond Me to Us

The joy brought by the birth of Jesus never ends with us alone. This joy leads us toward our neighbors and into broken relationships. Jesus said, “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matthew 5:9).

Those who have truly experienced the gospel develop wider hearts and learn to embrace others. It goes beyond merely avoiding conflict; it means stepping into broken relationships and actively creating peace. The joy of Christmas flows through us into the world, using us as instruments of peace—planting love where there is hatred, forgiveness where there is conflict, and hope where there is despair. This is the completion of the “great joy” we are called to enjoy and share.
