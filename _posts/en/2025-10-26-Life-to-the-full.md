John 10:1-12  
1 “Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.  
2 The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.  
3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  
4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.  
5 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”  
6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them.  
7 Therefore Jesus said again, “Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.  
8 All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.  
9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. They will come in and go out, and find pasture.  
10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.  
11 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  
12 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.

# 📖 The True Shepherd, Jesus Christ

In John 9, Jesus exposed the Pharisees’ spiritual blindness.  
In chapter 10, the focus shifts to **the one true Shepherd, Jesus Christ.**

The Bible describes our relationship with God in many ways:  
- Father and child  
- Bridegroom and bride  
- Vine and branches  
- Shepherd and sheep

All of these are **inseparable covenant relationships.**  
For Israel, once nomadic shepherds, the image of shepherd and sheep was deeply familiar.

# 📖 The Nature of Sheep and Our Condition

Pastor Philip Keller, who once raised sheep, observed:  
Sheep reflect the human condition well.  

- Weak and unable to survive alone  
- Defenseless, without weapons  
- Poor eyesight, easily lost  
- Stubborn and fearful  
- Absolutely dependent on the shepherd’s care  

**We too are like sheep—unable to live without our Shepherd.**

# 📖 The Hired Hand and the Thief

- **The hired hand**: does not own the sheep.  
  When the wolf comes, he abandons them. He works for wages, not for the sheep.  

- **The thief**: represents the Pharisees and teachers of the law.  
  They come only to steal, kill, and destroy.

# 📖 The Good Shepherd

Jesus declares:  
> “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” (John 10:11)

- The Good Shepherd protects His sheep even at the cost of His life.  
- Jesus gave His life on the cross to save us from thieves, wolves, and hired hands.  
- The Shepherd knows each sheep by name.  
  God knows us intimately because He created us.

# 📖 Hearing the Shepherd’s Voice

Sheep may have poor eyesight, but they have keen hearing.  
God gave them the ability to recognize the shepherd’s voice.  

- The Lord’s sheep hear and respond to His voice.  
- Through sermons, Bible study, and daily life, we must listen for His voice.  
- As faith matures, **God’s voice becomes clearer.**  
- We must not rely on our own reasoning or stubbornness, but on His voice.

# 📖 Life Abundantly

Jesus says:  
> “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” (John 10:10)

- A skilled shepherd leads to green pastures.  
- Psalm 23 reminds us:  
  > “Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me…”  
  God never lets go of His sheep.  
- John 10:28-29 promises:  
  > “No one will snatch them out of my hand.”

# 📖 Conclusion: Following the Shepherd

In John 21, Jesus’ encounter with Peter again reveals who the Good Shepherd is.  

Our task is simple:  
- Follow the Shepherd.  
- Live as His sheep.  
- Listen daily to His Word and obey, even when it conflicts with our own thoughts.
