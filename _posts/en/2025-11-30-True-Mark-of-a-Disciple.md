# 📖 The Upper Room Discourse and the Mark of a Disciple

In His final days, Jesus spent time with His disciples in the upper room.  
This farewell discourse contains the very heart of His teaching.  

- Jesus focused on the few rather than the crowds.  
- He poured Himself into the twelve disciples.  
- The mark of a disciple is simple: **one who loves others.**  

It is not attending worship or serving in church programs, but **loving one another** that proves true discipleship.

# 📖 The New Command: Love One Another

Religion has often been misused to harm people.  
History shows wars and terror committed in the name of God.  
But Jesus gave a new command:  
> “Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.”  

- A command is not optional advice but a divine order.  
- Jesus’ love was not words only but love expressed in action.

# 📖 Love That Embraced Judas

Jesus washed the feet of Judas and even gave him bread (John 13:26).  
Though betrayal was deeply painful, He still embraced Judas.  

Romans 5:8 says:  
> “But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”  

- Enemies are not destroyed by revenge but by love.  
- Christ’s love is unlike our conditional human love.

Jesus first commanded His disciples to love one another.  
Love begins in close relationships.  

- Love your parents, children, and spouse first.  
- Daily relationships matter most.  
- The church is not about performance but about process.  
- The true measure of the church is whether love is practiced.

# 📖 The Challenge of Love and Community

Love is not easy.  
We are all so different.  
Yet we must respect others as they are, even if they do not meet our standards.  

- Love is a command we cannot abandon.  
- Love is lived out in relationships.  
- Community heals loneliness and despair through love.

# 📖 The World Longs for Real Love

The world is abundant in resources but lacking in love.  
We, however, have experienced true love through Christ (1 John 4:11–19).  

- Jesus loved us more than Himself (1 John 4:7–8).  
- The power to change the world is not technology or civilization but **love.**  
- Through the church, the world can be transformed.  

Love means adjusting to others, yielding, listening, carrying burdens, and giving honor.

# 📖 Without Love, We Are Nothing

1 Corinthians 13 declares:  
> “If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.”  

Love is the foundation of all gifts and the essence of Christian identity. Without love, everything is meaningless.

Her sister died before her eyes under Nazi torture.  
After the war, while sharing her testimony in churches, she met the soldier who had tortured her.  
She thought, “I cannot love this man.”  
Yet obeying the Lord’s command, she embraced him.  

**Love the unlovable** — this is the Lord’s command.
