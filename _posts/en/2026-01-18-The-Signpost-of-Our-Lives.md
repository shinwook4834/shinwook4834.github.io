Matthew 28:16–20  
16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.  
17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.  
18 Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.  
19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  
20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

# 📖 Checking the Milestones of Life

When driving, road signs are crucial—they tell us where we are and where we are going. Missing them leads to wasted time or wrong destinations.  
Faith is the same. We must continually check our spiritual milestones to ensure we are heading in the right direction. Faith is not blind zeal but love and direction toward God.

# 📖 Why Do I Live?

Everyone seeks meaning in life. Without direction, we are like chaff blown by the wind (Psalm 1:4). Losing life’s essence and direction makes existence heavy and difficult.  

Today’s passage is the conclusion of Matthew’s Gospel and the opening of the church’s future. It is Jesus’ final words before His ascension—a testament for all believers. Here we find the most important milestones of our lives.

# 📖 The One with All Authority

Jesus declared: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.”  
Earthly powers fade, but His authority is eternal. God’s kingdom is not built by human effort but by His sovereign power. Our task is to align ourselves with His plan.

# 📖 The First Command: Go!

On this authority, Jesus commands us: **“Go.”**  
God sends us into the world. This is not only for missionaries with special callings. Every believer is sent as a witness. We ourselves are missionaries.  

“As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.” (John 20:21)  

When the early church tried to remain in Jerusalem, God scattered them through persecution (Acts 8). The church is both a gathering and a scattering community. If we do not scatter willingly, God may create circumstances to scatter us. We must remember our identity as missionaries in the world.

# 📖 The Core Mission: Make Disciples of All Nations

The second command is the core mission: **“Make disciples of all nations.”**  
Why all nations? Because God desires every nation to be saved and to praise Him (Psalm 67:4). His kingdom is far greater than our narrow boundaries. Our prayers must expand to embrace all nations.  

It is not enough to simply preach the gospel. We must make disciples. Crowds follow Jesus for their needs, but disciples surrender everything to follow Him. Our responsibility is to teach and guide people to become true disciples of Christ.

# 📖 The Greatest Promise: I Am with You

This mission is not easy. We cannot fulfill it by our own strength. That is why Jesus gave two great promises:  

**1. “I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”**  
He does not merely command us to go; He promises to walk with us. This is a missionary promise, given as encouragement for a difficult task.  

**2. The Holy Spirit will be given.**  
“But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses…” (Acts 1:8). When we live as witnesses, God supplies everything we need. We do not need to seek power separately. Those who obey the mission are given all they need. Ultimately, it is God who works. Our worries are transferred to Him, and we focus on seeking His kingdom and righteousness (Matthew 6:33).

# ✨ Conclusion: Existence Is the Essence

A flower does not exist to produce fragrance. It simply exists as a flower, and fragrance flows naturally.  
Likewise, if we are saved, sharing the gospel is not an extra task but the essence of our existence.  

Today, we must check our milestones again. Where am I heading? Does my life align with the mission Jesus gave? Let us see the signs clearly and walk boldly with Him.

# 💡 Reflection Q&A  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q1. Why is checking spiritual “milestones” important in faith?</span>  
A1. Because it helps us confirm our direction, ensuring that our zeal flows from true love for God rather than blind effort.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q2. What is life without direction compared to?</span>  
A2. Like chaff driven by the wind (Psalm 1:4), easily swayed by worldly values and circumstances.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q3. Is God’s kingdom built by human effort?</span>  
A3. No. It is established by Christ’s eternal authority, and our role is to align with His plan.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q4. To whom is the command “Go” given?</span>  
A4. It is given to all believers, not just missionaries. Every Christian is sent into the world as a witness.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q5. Why did Jesus say “all nations”?</span>  
A5. Because God’s salvation plan embraces every people group. The gospel must never be confined to one culture or boundary.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q6. What is the difference between crowds and disciples?</span>  
A6. Crowds follow Jesus for their own needs, but disciples surrender everything to obey Him. Our mission is to raise true disciples, not mere followers.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q7. What is the greatest promise Jesus gave with this mission?</span>  
A7. “I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” His abiding presence makes the mission possible.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q8. How does the Holy Spirit empower those on mission?</span>  
A8. By granting wisdom, courage, and strength at the right time, enabling us to live as faithful witnesses.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q9. What does the “flower and fragrance” metaphor teach us?</span>  
A9. Just as fragrance naturally flows from a flower, sharing the gospel flows naturally from the identity of the saved.  

<span style="color:lightblue">Q10. How should we reset our life’s milestones today?</span>  
A10. By making the Great Commission—“Go and make disciples of all nations”—the central purpose and highest priority of our lives.
