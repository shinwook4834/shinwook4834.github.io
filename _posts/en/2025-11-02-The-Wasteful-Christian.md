John 12:1–19  
1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, the one Jesus had raised from the dead.  
2 Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.  
3 Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.  
4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,  
5 “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.”  
6 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.  
7 “Leave her alone,” Jesus replied. “It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.  
8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”  
9 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.  
10 So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,  
11 for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him.  
12 The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.  
13 They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the King of Israel!”  
14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:  
15 “Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt.”  
16 At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him.  
17 Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.  
18 Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him.  
19 So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”

# 📖 Jesus Who Raised the Dead, and the Different Responses

The raising of Lazarus was a shocking event.  
The world marveled at this miracle, and many began to pay attention to Jesus.  
But the Pharisees took it as a reason to plot His death.  
The same event drew completely opposite responses.  

At Bethany, a banquet of thanksgiving was held.  
Martha and Mary prepared it to thank Jesus for raising their brother Lazarus.  
And in that setting, Mary performed an act that drew everyone’s attention.

# 📖 Mary’s Perfume — Worship That Gives All

![엘리엇의 일기](/assets/img/20251102-main-960.webp)

Mary took a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume, and poured it on Jesus’ feet.  
Its value was three hundred denarii, about a year’s wages for a laborer.  
She did not give a portion but poured out everything.  
For her, it may well have been her all.  

This scene reveals the essence of worship.  
If David was the worshiper of the Old Testament, Mary is the worshiper of the New.  
She bowed at Jesus’ feet, acknowledged Him as Lord,  
and offered her whole self to Him.  

Worship is not calculation but surrender.  
Mary even laid down her dignity.  
Wiping Jesus’ feet with her hair symbolized  
offering her honor to the Lord.

# 📖 Judas’ Perspective — A Pragmatic Faith

But Judas Iscariot said:  

> “Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.”  

At first glance, it sounds reasonable.  
It was practical and economical.  
But Judas’ concern was never the poor.  
His heart was on money.  
He would later sell Jesus for **thirty pieces of silver (about 120 denarii)**—  
far less than the value of Mary’s perfume.  

From Judas’ perspective, Mary’s act was wasteful.  
From Jesus’ perspective, it was holy devotion.

# 📖 Jesus Commends Mary’s “Holy Waste”

Jesus said:  

> “Leave her alone. It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.” (John 12:7)  

Mary sensed what was coming.  
Her act was misunderstood by others,  
but Jesus knew it was an expression of love for Him.  

Mary’s love was love beyond calculation.  
True love cannot be measured.  
Parents do not calculate their love for their children.  
When calculation enters, relationships collapse.  
The world lives by “this time me, next time you.”  
But true love is not calculation—it is devotion.

# 📖 Holy Waste — The Love of the Cross

The world runs on efficiency and calculation.  
But the gospel is the pinnacle of inefficiency, the ultimate “waste.”  
The cross—God giving His only Son for the sins of humanity—  
is the greatest “waste” of all.  
The Father gave His innocent Son for guilty sinners.  
That is holy waste.  

What are we “wasting” for the Lord?  
- Taking vacation time to go on mission  
- Spending much cost and time for worship  

The world calls it waste.  
Scripture calls it holy waste.

# 📖 A Life of Holy Waste — The Story of Jim Elliot

Missionary **Jim Elliot** went to bring the gospel to the Auca tribe in Ecuador.  
Within five days of beginning his mission, he was martyred.  

People said the death of such a gifted man was a “waste.”  
But his wife replied:  

![Jim Elliot’s Journal](/assets/img/20251102-01-540.webp)

> “He lived his whole life for that very moment.  
> His death was not a waste.”  

At age 19, Jim Elliot wrote in his journal:  

> “God, make my life a display case for Your glory.  
> This body is Yours. I do not ask for a long life.”  

His life looked like waste to the world,  
but in God’s kingdom it became an eternal fragrance.

# 📖 Love Beyond Calculation

The world obsesses over self-indulgent waste—  
better clothes, bigger houses, greater pleasures.  
But true waste is not for self, but for the Lord.  
To give your cloak to the naked is the most valuable waste.  

Jesus gladly received Mary’s holy waste.  
In Mark 14:9, He said:  

> “Wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world,  
> what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”  

Two thousand years later,  
we still remember Mary’s act of devotion.  

We too must open our eyes to holy waste—  
love that cannot be explained by calculation,  
devotion that cannot be understood by reason.  
That is the way of the Christian.
