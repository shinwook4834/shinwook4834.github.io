John 14:1–6  
1 “Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me."  
2 My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?  
3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.  
4 You know the way to the place where I am going.”  
5 Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”  
6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”

- He invited them to overcome anxiety through faith.

# 📖 The Prepared Place — The Reason for His Departure

Jesus did not leave them without purpose. He departed to prepare a place for His people.

# 📖 Thomas’ Question and Jesus’ Declaration

Thomas asked honestly:  
> “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”  

Jesus’ answer is the core of Christian faith:  
> “I am the way and the truth and the life.”  

- Way: the only path to God  
- Truth: absolute truth that pierces through all distortion  
- Life: the giver of eternal life  

Acts 4:12 echoes this:  
> “Salvation is found in no one else.”

We have a home to return to—the Father’s house.
