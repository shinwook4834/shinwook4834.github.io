Revelation 20:1-6  
1 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.  
2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.  
3 He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.  
4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  
5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.  
6 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.

# 📖 The Debate on the Millennium vs. The Core Truth

Revelation 20 has been one of the most debated passages in church history.  
Is the millennium before Christ’s return, after His return, or symbolic?  
Premillennialism, postmillennialism, and amillennialism all attempt to answer this.  

Yet the essence is not *when* or *how*, but **who is coming**.  
The unshakable truth is this: **Christ will return**.  
The New Testament mentions His second coming 318 times.  
If this hope collapses, the foundation of Christian faith collapses with it.

# 📖 The Present Power of Future Hope

We live within the frame of past, present, and future.  
But every life inevitably moves toward an end.  
Death is universal and impartial.  

- If tomorrow were our last day, today would look entirely different.  
- The hope of Christ’s return makes us live with urgency and clarity.  
- Believing in the end simplifies and purifies our lives.  

C.S. Lewis once wrote:  
> “If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.”

# 📖 Satan’s Limits and God’s Sovereignty

The vision shows Satan bound for a thousand years.  
Though still active, his power is already broken.  

- He deceives, tempts, and prowls like a roaring lion.  
- Yet all his activity is under God’s sovereign control.  
- The destiny of believers is not in Satan’s hands but in God’s.  

Therefore, we need not fear.  
**Christ’s victory is already our victory.**

# 📖 The Glorious Position of the Saints

John sees thrones and those seated upon them.  
They are given authority to judge and reign with Christ.  

- Martyrs, faithful witnesses, and those who resisted the beast share in this glory.  
- Those who partake in the first resurrection are blessed and holy.  
- The second death has no power over them.  

**Those who suffer with Christ will reign with Him in glory.**

# 📖 The Failure of Human Utopias

History is filled with failed dreams of utopia.  
Communism, secular humanism, and materialistic capitalism all promised paradise but delivered despair.  

- Wars, injustice, inequality, disease, and disasters remain.  
- Human effort cannot bring salvation.  

**Only the returning Christ will judge the world and bring the new heaven and new earth.**

# 📖 Living a Prepared Life

Jesus said:  
> “So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.” (Matt. 24:44)

- Do not be trapped only in the present.  
- Do not neglect the present by obsessing over the future.  
- Eschatological faith makes today sharper and more purposeful.  

Paul testified:  
> “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness…” (2 Tim. 4:7-8)

---

# 📖 Conclusion: Reigning with Christ

The book of Revelation ends with this promise:  
> “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.” (Rev. 22:20)

Christians are those who live in readiness.  
Eschatological faith is not escapism but the power to live faithfully today.  
**Those who endure with Christ will reign with Him forever.**
