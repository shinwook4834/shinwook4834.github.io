28 I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”  
29 Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.  
30 Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.”  
31 “You believe at last!” Jesus answered.  
32 “But a time is coming, and has in fact come, when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.  
33 “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”

# 📖 Jesus’ Final Sermon on the Last Sunday of the Year

Today is the last Sunday of 2025. As we close the year, we encounter Jesus' final farewell sermon. John 16 captures the moment just before Jesus leaves the world, giving His last essential instructions to the disciples who would remain. The disciples confess their belief, claiming they now understand His words. However, their confession stems from a premature confidence, unaware of their own weakness and ignorance. The Lord sees through their hearts and poses a question.

# 📖 "Do You Now Believe?"

In response to the disciples' confession of faith, Jesus asks, "Do you now believe?" This question is not meant to doubt their faith but is an expression of His deep love, prompting them to examine their own belief. In many moments when we think we are 'believing,' that faith may not be genuine. It doesn't usually show in ordinary times. But when life's crises hit, false faith collapses like a house built on sand. True faith demonstrates its power in the face of crisis. The Lord wanted His disciples to reflect on their faith before the impending ordeal.

# 📖 The Lord Standing Alone Amidst the Scattering

The Lord precisely foretells what is about to happen: “A time is coming, and has in fact come, when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone.” When the crisis strikes, the disciples will scatter and flee in confusion. They were not yet prepared to endure suffering with the Lord. Without true faith, one loses direction in life and is quick to run away from crisis. Yet, remarkably, the Lord says, “Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.” Even in that place of despair where everyone had left, the Lord was never alone.

# 📖 Peace Experienced in the Midst of Tribulation

Jesus clearly states the reason for all these words in verse 33: “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace.” The Lord promises us peace. But this peace does not mean a life without tribulation. On the contrary, the Lord affirms, “In this world you will have trouble.” Living as a Christian can sometimes be a path of hardship, facing people's hatred, experiencing loneliness, and enduring injustice. The Lord's promise is not the removal of tribulation, but a heavenly peace enjoyed in the midst of all trials and difficulties. It is a wondrous peace, like a table prepared in the presence of our enemies. What is crucial is that we enjoy this peace 'in the Lord.' Faith does not change the situation; it changes 'me' who faces the situation.

# 📖 "Take Heart! I Have Overcome the World"

Following the promise of peace, the Lord declares victory. This powerful command, "Take heart," which appears only once in the Gospel of John, is built on a solid foundation: the Lord's declaration of victory, “I have overcome the world.” This victory is final and complete, accomplished through the cross and resurrection. Because we are in the victorious Christ, we are destined to win. Just as we can watch a replay of a game we've already won with a relaxed heart, we are people who live knowing the end of the war called life. Our courage comes not from an ability to predict the future, but from faith that trusts in Christ's victory.

# ✨ Conclusion: God’s Victory Beyond Our Failures

The world often packages defeat to look like victory and is easily deceived by false triumphs. The disciples, too, were deceived by the apparent defeat of the cross and scattered. This is the reality of weak humans who are bound to fail. Looking back on the year, our lives have had numerous moments of failure and discouragement. We must honestly acknowledge our failures. But the story does not end here. God does not leave us as orphans in our failure; He took responsibility for us by sending His only Son, Jesus. As theologian John Calvin described in the 'perseverance of the saints,' God never lets go of the people He has chosen, leading them beyond failure to the place of ultimate victory. Even if we continue to fail, the Lord does not give up on us and constantly draws us to Himself. As the new year approaches, let us not be discouraged by difficulties, but trust in the Lord who has already overcome the world and advance with courage. The final victory is ours.

<span style="color:lightblue">Q6. What is the fundamental reason we can be courageous in the midst of tribulation?</span>

<span style="color:lightblue">Q8. What is the difference between the world's concept of victory and the Bible's?</span>
