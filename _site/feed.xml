    <h2 id="todays-recovery-meal-for-my-husband-returning-from-a-business-trip">Today’s Recovery Meal for My Husband Returning from a Business Trip</h2>

<p>Whenever my husband comes back from a business trip, he looks especially tired. So I always prepare a <strong>recovery meal</strong> for him. This time, I made <strong>braised short ribs (galbijjim), japchae, and chive pancakes</strong>—his favorites. These dishes take time and effort, but they’re filled with love and care.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="starting-with-galbijjim">Starting with Galbijjim</h3>

<p>First, I thoroughly wash the <strong>beef short ribs</strong> and soak them in <strong>sugar water to remove the blood</strong>. It’s a time-consuming step, but essential to eliminate any unpleasant odor.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_B-preparation-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>While the ribs soak, I prepare the <strong>sauce and ingredients</strong>. I followed a recipe from Salimpop:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <ul>
    <li>Soy sauce 20T</li>
    <li>Mirim 10T</li>
    <li>Sugar 3T</li>
    <li>Oligodang (rice syrup) 4T</li>
    <li>Garlic 4T</li>
    <li>Oyster sauce 3T</li>
    <li>Pepper 1T</li>
    <li>Sesame oil 1T</li>
    <li>Ginger 1T</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I cut the onions into large chunks for the galbijjim and thin slices for japchae and chive pancakes. Using a slicer makes prep much faster.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_V-preparation-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>I also prepare plenty of chives for both japchae and pancakes. I love adding chives to japchae—they help balance the richness. Shiitake mushrooms are cut into star shapes for galbijjim and thin slices for japchae. Colorful bell peppers are sliced to brighten the dish. After soaking, the ribs are blanched in boiling water for 10 minutes. I added <strong>star anise</strong> for extra aroma.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_B-Boil-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Then I pour the sauce over the blanched ribs, add 2L of water, and toss in all the prepared vegetables. Once it starts boiling, I simmer it <strong>covered for 40 minutes</strong>, then <strong>uncovered for another 40 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_B-Boiled-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Finally, I add <strong>shishito peppers</strong> for a pop of color and flavor. By now, the house is filled with a delicious aroma.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="simple-yet-delicious-chive-pancakes">Simple Yet Delicious Chive Pancakes</h3>

<p>Here are the ingredients for the chive pancakes:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <ul>
    <li>3T flour</li>
    <li>Dried baby shrimp</li>
    <li>Tuna fish sauce</li>
    <li>Carrot</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I use minimal flour—just 3T. I add <strong>dried baby shrimp</strong> for texture and umami, and season with <strong>tuna fish sauce</strong>.</p>

<p>Mix everything well and pan-fry until golden brown. The result is crispy pancakes with a fragrant chive aroma.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_J-boil-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Though simple, chive pancakes require attention. The batter consistency and pan temperature are key. But the crispy texture and chive flavor make it a perfect dish for my husband.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="japchaeeven-with-a-small-mistake">Japchae—Even with a Small Mistake</h3>

<p>Japchae sauce includes:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <ul>
    <li>Olive oil 2T</li>
    <li>Soy sauce 5T</li>
    <li>Sugar 1T</li>
    <li>Mirin 1T</li>
    <li>Oligodang 2T</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>When the sauce starts boiling, I was supposed to add the noodles—but I accidentally added the meat first 😅 It was past midnight, and I was losing focus.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_J-done-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Still, I didn’t give up. I added fresh vegetables and stir-fried them with the noodles. Finished with <strong>sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds</strong>.</p>

<p>Japchae requires a lot of prep and careful timing. Though things got a bit mixed up, I tried my best to make it tasty. With chives, bell peppers, and shiitake mushrooms, it turned out colorful and flavorful.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="all-done-a-meal-full-of-love">All Done! A Meal Full of Love</h3>

<p>After finishing galbijjim, japchae, and chive pancakes, it was nearly dawn. Thankfully, my mom helped with cleanup and organizing the kitchen—her help was invaluable.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/03_all-done-960.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Seeing my husband enjoy the meal made all the effort worthwhile. Though I was exhausted, his smile and satisfaction filled me with gratitude.</p>

<p>Cooking takes time, but it’s a way to express love. Especially when it’s for family. Next time, I’ll share a simpler yet equally comforting recovery meal. Wishing you a delicious day!</p>

    <p>Hello :)<br />
Today I made one of our family’s favorite dishes — Boston butt pilaf.<br />
My husband especially loves it, and it’s a simple recipe packed with flavor that makes a satisfying meal.</p>

<p>🧅 Preparing the Vegetables and Marinating the Boston butt<br />
I used whatever vegetables we had at home for the pilaf:</p>

<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <ul>
    <li>Zucchini</li>
    <li>Carrot</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Mushrooms</li>
    <li>400g Boston butt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The Boston butt was marinated overnight beforehand.
Bell peppers feel like an essential ingredient — they definitely add more flavor!
It’s best to chop the vegetables into small pieces so they cook evenly and mix well with the rice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-preparation.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
My husband loves meat, so I used a generous amount of Boston butt 😄
Make sure the marinade isn’t too salty so the meat’s natural flavor shines through.
Marinating overnight makes the meat more tender and flavorful.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-lets-start-stir-frying">🍳 Let’s Start Stir-Frying!</h2>

<p>First, stir-fry the onions and carrots.
You don’t need much oil since the vegetables release moisture as they cook naturally.
Next, add the zucchini and mushrooms and stir-fry together.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-Moksal.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>When they’re somewhat cooked, add the marinated Boston butt.</p>

<p>Once the meat starts cooking, add 2 bowls of cooled rice and stir-fry together.
It’s better if the rice isn’t too hot.</p>

<p>Add 1 tbsp oyster sauce and 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce to enhance the flavor.
Stir-fry until the bottom gets slightly crispy — that makes it even tastier!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-main.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>The pilaf was a bit sticky since the rice was a little wet, but that’s part of its charm too, haha.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-with-fried-eggs">🍳 With Fried Eggs</h2>

<p>No pilaf is complete without fried eggs!
Since it was for two people, I fried 4 eggs generously.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-Egg.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>The yolks cooked slightly runny, which tastes best.
We also enjoyed it with some spicy chopped chili on the side.</p>

<p>Adding fried eggs makes the dish look more appealing and adds a nutty richness, making the pilaf more hearty.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="/assets/img/02_Pliaf-Final.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Sharing this meal with my beloved husband and baby
feels warmer and more special than any fancy dish.</p>

<p>This one plate of pilaf enriches our day.</p>

<p>I hope you try making this at home :)
This simple Boston butt pilaf recipe will bring more happiness to your day.</p>

    <p>Hello there :)<br />
Today, I’d love to share my experience making one of my favorite breads — <strong>salt bread</strong> — at home.<br />
My husband especially loves this bread, so I bake it quite often. This time, I followed Duke’s recipe.<br />
I’m self-taught in baking, so there may be some rough edges, but that just means the recipe is full of love.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-lets-start-with-the-ingredients">🧑‍🍳 Let’s Start with the Ingredients</h2>
<blockquote class="prompt-tip">

  <p>First, let’s measure everything:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bread flour: 200g</li>
    <li>Cake flour: 50g</li>
    <li>Skim milk powder: 15g (I used leftover baby formula instead)</li>
    <li>Dry yeast: 3g</li>
    <li>Salt: 5g</li>
    <li>Sugar: 15g</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to keep the yeast, salt, and sugar from touching each other directly.<br />
Coat each with flour before mixing all the dry ingredients evenly.</p>

<p>Next, add 165ml of water.<br />
Here’s a key tip! Use <strong>tap water</strong> — it helps fermentation more than purified water.<br />
Mix with a spatula until it clumps together, then let it <strong>rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-time-to-knead">🌀 Time to Knead!</h2>

<p>After 30 minutes, it’s time to knead.<br />
I used the <strong>L’EQUIP dough mixer</strong> (not sponsored 😊).<br />
The great thing about this mixer is that it automatically adjusts speed and time with one button,<br />
and even tells you when to add butter — super helpful for home bakers!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-mixer.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Once the dough is ready, tidy it up and start fermentation.<br />
Cover with plastic wrap to prevent drying, and let it <strong>ferment at room temperature for 60 minutes</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-shaping-and-resting">🍞 Shaping and Resting</h2>

<p>After fermentation, divide the dough into <strong>70g portions</strong>.<br />
This recipe makes 6 salt breads.<br />
If there’s leftover dough, just add a bit to each of the 6 portions.</p>

<p>Now let’s round the dough.<br />
Fold it inward, then roll it into a ball on a mat or with your palm.<br />
Next, shape it into a <strong>tadpole shape</strong> — tapering toward the tail is key!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-shaping01.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>rest at room temperature for 20 minutes</strong>.<br />
After resting, stretch the dough.<br />
Push the top part and pull the bottom part downward as you roll.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-shaping02.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-butter-filling-and-shaping-tips">🧈 Butter Filling and Shaping Tips</h2>

<p>Now place the butter filling on the top part and gently roll it up.<br />
Repeat the same for the rest of the dough.</p>

<p>Some salt bread recipes suggest sealing the sides after adding butter,<br />
while others leave them open.</p>

<p>Korean master baker <strong>Bread Junseo</strong> says:<br />
“For salt bread, leaving the sides open allows the butter to naturally flow out and absorb into the bottom,<br />
making it crispy.”<br />
So I also leave the sides open.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-final-proof-and-baking">🔥 Final Proof and Baking</h2>

<p>Let the shaped dough <strong>proof for about 60 minutes</strong>.<br />
Usually, you sprinkle a bit of salt on top after proofing,<br />
but I skipped that this time.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to <strong>220°C</strong>,<br />
then bake at <strong>200°C for 20 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-beforebake.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>Once baked, your salt bread is ready!<br />
It’s delicious as is, but if you <strong>brush a little leftover butter on top</strong>,<br />
it adds a glossy finish and makes it look even more appetizing.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/01_saltbread-baked.webp" width="972" height="688" alt="" decoding="async" loading="eager" class="" /></p>

<p>After cooling a bit, cracks may appear on the surface —<br />
but I find that adds to its charm.</p>

<h2 id="-wrapping-up">💛 Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Though I’m self-taught and still learning,<br />
the biggest reward is seeing my <strong>family enjoy the bread</strong>.<br />
Since it’s my husband’s favorite, I keep coming back to it.</p>

<p>Salt bread uses simple ingredients,<br />
and with a little care, you can make it delicious at home.</p>

<p>I hope you give it a try :)<br />
The savory aroma from the oven and a warm table<br />
can make your day just a little happier.</p>
